As a first-year master student of Peking University, China, I have been studying visual SLAM/VO for two years. During these years, I have done many projects about both classic and learning-based SLAM, and our recent work has been accepted in CVPR 2019 as oral presentation (I am the second author). I'm familiar with both classic and learning-based SLAM/VO frameworks and commonly-used benchmark datasets. Project 6 is about developing a toolbox to evaluate the performance of different SLAM algorithms, and I have done similar work during my research. So I think I am qualified for project 6. I hope I can be selected as a member of GSoC this time, and I will work hard to complete this task.
